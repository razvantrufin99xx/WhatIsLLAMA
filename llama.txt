LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of autoregressive language models developed by Meta AI. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Architecture**: LLaMA is built on the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network designed for handling sequential data, like text. This architecture allows the model to process and generate text efficiently³.

2. **Training**: The model is trained on a vast amount of text data from the internet and other sources. For example, LLaMA 2 was trained on approximately 2 trillion words⁴. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence, given the previous words. This process helps the model understand language patterns and context.

3. **Text Generation**: When you input a text prompt, LLaMA uses its learned patterns to predict and generate the most plausible continuation of the text. It does this by recursively predicting the next word until it completes the response³.

4. **Capabilities**: LLaMA can perform various tasks such as text generation, language translation, and answering complex questions. It can also engage in natural and engaging conversations with users¹.

5. **Access**: The model weights and source code for LLaMA are available to the public, but obtaining the original model weights requires filling out a form on the Meta AI website¹.
